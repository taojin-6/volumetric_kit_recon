///        from the next (@ref ServerOptions::replay_gop), then every record
///        as it is published (a @ref StreamClient reads them).
///
/// **The wire is the file.** A viewer receives the `VRST` chunk, then `RECD`
/// chunks byte for byte as `stream::StreamWriter` writes them, with no footer
/// (`stream::ChunkEncoder`).
///
/// A viewer takes its next record only while its socket holds under 128 KiB
/// unsent (`TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT`), so little backlog hides in the kernel. A
/// P-frame is never sent without the records it is predicted from.
///
/// **Newest key wins.** When a newer key arrives before a viewer has sent
/// the records before it, the viewer finishes the chunk under way, skips the
/// rest and goes on from that key, so one slower than the stream stays
/// within about a GOP of it.
///
/// **Joining at the GOP** (@ref ServerOptions::replay_gop, the default). The
/// server keeps one GOP: the newest key record and every record after it. A
/// viewer joins at that key, so it decodes at once. A viewer's first record,
/// after its `VRST` chunk, is the GOP's key, and the server keeps every
/// record since. So once a viewer has the session, it misses no record
/// published after, except by newest key wins.
///
/// **Keys on demand** (`replay_gop` false). A viewer joins waiting for the
/// next key, and from it gets every record, in order, except by newest key
/// wins, while it stays within @ref ServerOptions::max_gop_bytes of the
/// newest. One that a record would take further behind finishes the chunk
/// under way and waits for the next key again. The server keeps only the
/// records a viewer still has to send. Each join and each fall-back counts in
/// @ref key_wanted, so a live sender makes its next frame a key and the
/// viewer waits one frame.
///
/// **Threads.** @ref publish never waits on a socket or a viewer: it copies
/// the record once, takes one lock and wakes the viewers. One thread accepts
/// and one thread per viewer sends. A viewer that joins, leaves or fails is
/// logged at Info, and never reaches @ref publish.
