/// @brief A mesh still in the device buffers that produced it -- the handoff
///        between two GPU passes with no host copy in between.
///
/// The `mesh` tier writes its geometry into a `VkBuffer` and the `texture` tier
/// rewrites `Vertex::uv0` in place, so routing one to the other through a host
/// `Mesh` costs a full readback *and* a full re-upload of the same bytes
/// (~45 MB each at a ~940 k-vertex room scan) for no reason. A @ref DeviceMesh
/// names those buffers instead, and the host copy happens once, when a caller
/// actually needs a `Mesh`.
///
/// **Borrowed, not owned.** The buffers belong to the producing extractor,
/// which reuses them across calls, so a @ref DeviceMesh is valid only until the
/// next extract on that same extractor -- exactly like a pointer into a
/// container that the next insert may invalidate. Copying the struct copies the
/// handles, not the storage.
///
/// @ref generation is what makes that rule *enforceable*. Comparing buffer
/// handles cannot detect the common case: the producer reuses one grow-only
/// arena, so a superseded view names the very same `VkBuffer` as the live one
/// and would compare equal while the contents had been replaced. The producer
/// therefore stamps a counter it bumps on every extract, and
/// `MarchingCubes::download` accepts only its current value.
///
/// The index buffer exists because the consuming kernels address vertices
/// through it, and because the renderer wants a real one at the interop seam.
/// Whether it is the identity run `0, 1, 2, ...` depends on @ref
/// shares_vertices -- do not assume either way.
///
/// **When a triangle's arena slot is a durable name.** Since 2026-08-12 a
/// cell's triangles land at a *scanned* offset inside its block's range rather
/// than wherever an atomic handed them out, so within a block the slot is
/// `f(block base, cell, triangle-in-cell)`. That makes per-triangle state keyed
/// by slot -- a progressive texture atlas, above all -- survive a re-mesh that
/// did not change the triangulation, but only as far as the **block base** is
/// itself stable, and that is a property of the *call*, not of this struct:
///
/// - `MarchingCubes::extract_device` reserves every block base through one
///   global atomic, which hands ranges out in workgroup arrival order. Two full
///   extracts of an unchanged field can therefore permute whole blocks, and no
///   slot survives.
/// - `MarchingCubes::extract_device_incremental` reuses a block's existing
///   range in place wherever the new count still fits, and only then is the
///   slot durable. A block that outgrew its range relocates, and a block the
///   pass declined to re-mesh keeps everything it had.
///
/// Which of the two happened is *visible*, not something to assume: @ref
/// ExtractTimings::incremental says whether the incremental pass ran at all
/// (it falls back silently), and `MarchingCubes::block_spans()` publishes each
/// block's `triangle_base` -- guarded by `block_span_valid()` -- so a consumer
/// that caches the previous extract's bases can tell a reused range from a
/// relocated one per block and invalidate exactly what moved.
