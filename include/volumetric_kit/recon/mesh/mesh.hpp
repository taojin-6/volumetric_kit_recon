/// @brief One mesh vertex: world-space position + normal, and the hybrid
///        appearance the reconstruction handoff carries -- a per-vertex color
///        and an atlas texture coordinate.
///
/// This is also the on-device layout the marching-cubes kernel writes: under
/// scalar block layout a GLSL
/// `struct { vec3 position; vec3 normal; vec4 color; vec2 uv0; }` is
/// byte-identical to this POD (position @0, normal @12, color @24, uv0 @40,
/// 48 B), so the host reads the vertex buffer back with a plain `memcpy` -- the
/// same one-struct-across-CPU/GLSL discipline the volume tier applies to @ref
/// volume::HashEntry (the 2026-07-05 ABI). The `static_assert`s below pin the
/// host packing; the GLSL mirror keeps its `layout(scalar)` definition in
/// lockstep.
///
/// @ref color and @ref uv0 encode the **hybrid** color path shared with the
/// renderer's `HybridMeshPipeline`: where projective texturing won a triangle a
/// camera, @ref uv0 holds an atlas coordinate; where it did not, @ref uv0 is
/// the
/// `(-1, -1)` sentinel and the shader falls back to @ref color (the color TSDF
/// integration fused into the volume, interpolated here). Marching cubes fills
/// @ref color and leaves @ref uv0 at the sentinel; the projective-texturing
/// pass (a later slice) overwrites @ref uv0 for textured triangles. @ref
/// tangent is here only to hold the renderer's layout in place: meshing cannot
/// derive one, so the kernel writes a fixed placeholder into it.
