/// @file math/vector_types.hpp
/// @brief Vector/matrix vocabulary types shared by host code and GPU kernels.
///
/// These are thin aliases over GLM rather than hand-rolled structs, for three
/// reasons. GLM is the renderer's (`volumetric_kit_gfx`) math library, so
/// sharing it keeps the interop seam free of vector-type conversions. Its types
/// are trivially-copyable, standard-layout PODs whose packed layout (`vec3` =
/// 12 B, `vec4` = 16 B, `mat4` = 64 B, column-major) mirrors a GLSL **scalar
/// block layout** (`GL_EXT_scalar_block_layout`) block byte-for-byte -- the
/// host side of the buffer ABI the Vulkan compute shaders read (the shader
/// keeps its `layout(scalar)` definition in lockstep; see the gotchas in
/// DESIGN.md). Plain `std430` is deliberately not used: it 16-byte-aligns a
/// `vec3`, breaking the byte-for-byte match for the voxel-hash structs that
/// embed one. And GLM qualifies its operators `__host__ __device__` under nvcc,
/// so the same types and math are callable inside the native-CUDA accelerator's
/// kernels (locked decision, 2026-07-04)
/// -- exactly what the earlier hand-rolled POD types reproduced by hand.
///
/// The `vr::` names are kept as the project's vocabulary so call sites don't
/// bind to `glm::` directly and the backing type stays swappable. Matrices are
/// column-major, matching GLM / Vulkan conventions; a default-constructed
/// `glm::mat4` is indeterminate -- spell the identity `Mat4f(1.0f)`.
