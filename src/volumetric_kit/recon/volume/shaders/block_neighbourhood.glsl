// the flat grid it replaced was NOT more densely packed: at block_size 8,
// voxels_per_block is 512 = 2*256, so `gid / 512` was already constant across
// each 256-thread group and every workgroup belonged to one block. Only the
// group count changed (2 per block -> 1). So the levers are the probe --
// spreading the 8 across subgroups, or one lane per bucket slot with a
// reduction -- not the cell or block count. Left unmeasured rather than guessed
// at; the repo's own lesson is to profile the phase before optimising it. Note
